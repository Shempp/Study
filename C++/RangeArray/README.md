# Range container to quickly find ranges
Need to write a container that stores an object of type RANGE {start_address, size}. The container should be able to add, remove, and search for objects. Deletion can occur both at the address and by the {start_address, size} pair. The search should take place at the address: search function 'find (address)' must find all objects in the container, for execution the rule address > = RANGE.start_address && address < RANGE.start_address + RANGE.size. Also need for the application to write all unreleased memory regions at the exit. The output should be in the format of file, line, size, <first 20 bytes of content>
