# Simple implementaion of function 'trim_all' (removing extra spaces)
To build the program you need a [boost](https://www.boost.org/) library (if you need comparisons of performance and execution result) or you can just take file [Trim.h](https://github.com/Shempp/Study/blob/master/C%2B%2B/RemoveExtraSpaces/Trim.h) and use it.
## Full description of the task
Given a string with excessive spaces
Extra spaces need to be removed
```
before: _On__my___home_world
after:  On_my_home_world
```
What you want to see:
- Inplace algorithm with complexity **O(N)** in time and **O(1)** in memory
